Java Dockerfile

```
# Stage 1: Build
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app

COPY mvnw pom.xml ./
COPY .mvn .mvn

RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline
COPY src src
RUN ./mvnw clean package

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup

COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup --from=build /app/target/apigate-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

USER appuser
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
EXPOSE 8080
```
1. Multi-stage Build
I used a two-stage build process. The first stage, named build, handles everything needed to compile the application, including the full JDK and Maven. The second stage, runtime, is where the final, much smaller image is created. This approach drastically reduces the size and attack surface of the final image because it only contains the application and a minimal JRE, without any of the build tools.

2. Enhancing Docker's Copy-on-Write (CoW)
I optimized my Dockerfile to take advantage of Docker's layer caching, which is an application of Copy-on-Write. I copied the pom.xml and Maven wrapper first, then ran the dependency:go-offline command. This creates a Docker layer with all my project's dependencies. Since the dependencies rarely change, this layer is cached. When I rebuild the image after only making changes to the source code, Docker doesn't have to re-download or re-process the dependencies. It just re-uses the cached layer and builds a new layer for my changed source code, which makes subsequent builds incredibly fast.

3. Using Minimal Base Images (JDK vs. JRE)
I chose the eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine for the build stage and eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine for the runtime stage. I used the full JDK in the build stage because it's required to compile the Java source code. However, for the runtime stage, I switched to the much smaller JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The JRE contains everything needed to run the compiled application, but none of the development tools, resulting in a smaller final image.

4. Running as a Non-Root User
For security, I created a dedicated user and group (appuser:appgroup) and configured the container to run the application as that user. This prevents the application from having root-level permissions, which is a critical security best practice.

5. Only Copying the Final JAR
In the final runtime stage, I only copy the necessary JAR file from the build stage using the --from=build flag. This prevents any unnecessary files, such as source code or temporary build files, from ending up in the final image, further reducing its size and improving its security.




React Dockerfile

```
# Stage 1: Build React app
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve with Nginx
FROM nginx:stable-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

# Create non-root user & group, copy build output, fix ownership in one layer
RUN addgroup -S www && adduser -D -G www appuser && \
    rm -rf ./* && \
    mkdir -p /var/cache/nginx /var/run /var/log/nginx && \
    chown -R appuser:www /usr/share/nginx/html /var/cache/nginx /var/run /var/log/nginx

# Copy nginx.conf (overwrites default) & React build
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY --from=build /app/build ./

EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```


1. Multi-stage Build
I used a two-stage build process. The first stage, named build, handles the compilation of my React application, including all the Node.js tools and dependencies. The second stage, serve, is where I create the final production image using Nginx to serve the static files. This keeps the final image incredibly small and secure by excluding the entire Node.js development environment.

2. Enhancing Docker's Copy-on-Write (CoW)
I optimized this for faster builds by leveraging Docker's layer caching. I first copy package.json and package-lock.json and run npm ci to install dependencies. Since dependencies change less frequently than the source code, this creates a stable, cached layer. When I make changes to the source code, Docker only needs to re-run the COPY . . and npm run build steps, which saves a lot of time.

3. Using Minimal Base Images
I chose the node:20-alpine and nginx:stable-alpine images. The alpine variant is a very lightweight Linux distribution, which makes the images much smaller and more efficient compared to images based on larger operating systems. This reduces my final image size and improves security.

4. Combining RUN Commands
I combined multiple related commands into a single RUN instruction. This is a crucial optimization for Copy-on-Write (CoW). Each RUN command in a Dockerfile creates a new layer. By chaining commands like addgroup, adduser, rm -rf, mkdir, and chown together with &&, I significantly reduce the number of layers and produce a more efficient image.

5. Running as a Non-Root User
For security, I created a dedicated non-root user (appuser) and group (www) and granted them ownership of the necessary Nginx directories. This prevents the application from running with elevated root privileges, which is a critical security best practice.

6. Copying Only the Final Artifact
In the final serve stage, I only copy the compiled React build output from the build stage using COPY --from=build. This ensures that my final Nginx image contains only the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, with no unnecessary build artifacts or source code.
